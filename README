# Please Go On Sale
This was a project to help my now fianc√© find out when items would go on sale.

There is a bookmarklet she would use to tag items at online stores and then process would keep checking that page to see if
the item would go on sale.

It turns out that trying to track a specific item in the righ size and color without access to an inventory api or
database is really hard. Skus can and do change which really throws things off. There wasn't always unique id to help
track things down. 

There are some other products out there that do this, but we both lost interest after a while and moved on.
